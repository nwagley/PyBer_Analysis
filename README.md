# PyBer Analysis 

### Overview 
The purpose of this assignment is to use Pandas to create a summary Data Frame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
Once we get the data, we will plot the results in the graph which will show the weekly results for each city type. We 
will then have to summarize the data to see the differnces. 

### Results
Looking at data found we can see the following information

#### Rural  
There a total of 78 rural drivers in the system. The amoumt of total fares is approx $4300 with 34.62 being the average fare
per rider and 55.48 being the average fare per driver. 

#### Suburban
There a total of 490 rural drivers in the system. The amoumt of total fares is approx $19300 with 30.97 being the average fare
per rider and 39.50 being the average fare per driver. 

#### Urban 
There a total of 1625 rural drivers in the system. The amoumt of total fares is approx $40000 with 24.97 being the average fare
per rider and 16.57 being the average fare per driver. 

We see that even though there is a more total rides and drivers in the urban area the fare prices for the driver is sell than what it 
is in the rural, this can be explain as there is less competition and more chances of getting a ride.

### Summary 
Looking at the above final graph the recommendations I would make to the CEO are 1) The comapny has to promote its services in the rural 
areas by using the fare advantages as the drives make more money vs Urban cities to raise profit. 2) The customer based needs to enticed 
in the suburban communities in the month of April where we see a huge delice for some reason. 3) majority of the company profits are made 
the urban drivers and riders in the month of March so I would recommend the CEO to focus more on these months why there is decline in April 
vs March in one regular season.
